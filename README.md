###  PURPOSE
DudeBros Incorporated (DudeBros Inc.) were experiencing staff retention problems. Despite their best intentions and efforts, their workforce consisted almost entirely of white collar middle-aged males.\
Over the years, they had employed a diverse group of people that were best suited to each role and were top of their field,  but no matter the pay packet or benefits thrown at them, DudeBros Inc. simply couldn't seem to keep their staff happy or wanting to stay. \
The resounding feedback given in the seemingly countless resignation letters was that it was no place for anyone who didn't quite fit that same macho stereotype. \
So, instead of doubling down and continuing the cycle, we (Ella, Jack and Naomi) were stoked to get a call from DudeBros Inc. asking for help to change their company culture:\
And that is where *I Got You, Boo* was born.\
The obvious answer was to create some sort of support network for females to feel included, and have a safe place where they could ask for advice, feedback, and other girls alongside them when they felt wildly outnumbered in the workplace.\
However, this concept grew: because it's not just women who were in the minority. \
It was also members of the LGBTQI+ community. It was people of colour. It was even red heads, as we found out!\
IGYB is a forum with a mentee/mentor mindset encouraged. The purpose of this is to be able to give a safe space for people to reach out to others in a similar role or industry who have possibly fought the same battles, or have learnt by experience, and are now in a place to share that wealth of knowledge and help pave the way in similar circumstances.

### TARGET AUDIENCE
We're proud to say that *I Got You, Boo (IGYB)* is an all-inclusive online community for those who feel like they're on the outer, because everyone should have someone who has their back.\
While the aim is for people in industries that might be lacking in diversity to have people they can surround themselves with online, it doesn't necessarily have to be strictly business: for example, one of our most recent Superstars is a 17yo male who wanted to learn to crochet, but didn't feel comfortable walking into his local nursing home crochet classes: and he was able to find other Superstars here who have helped him in that journey!\
We consider every single member of IGYB a Superstar, so that's what we refer to our users as.

### FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURES
At its core, IGYB is a forum where guests can browse through posts, comments, and events, and create an account if they want to join the community.\
Upon logging in, those users (our Superstars) can create posts, comment on posts, and create personally organised events, as well as update their details in their account profile.\
The IGYB Crew are employees, and essentially website admins. This gives them the ability to moderate if necessary. The entire IGYB idea is built on trust and mutual respect, so this isn't a matter of trawling through every single post and comment to follow any particular 'rules', but it still gives IGYB Crew the capability to delete posts, comments or events that have been created and do not uphold the inclusive ethos of IGYB, or to completely delete Superstars if they are deemed offensive. Similar to Superstars, IGYB Crew can also create posts, comments, and official IGYB events.

The framework of the IGYB site is as follows:

**HEADER**\
‘I got you, boo’ - nice and congruent across every page and device

**TOP LINKS**\
Desktop view: ABOUT, COMMUNITY, CONTACT, PROFILE (icon)\
Mobile and tablet view: PROFILE (icon), and MENU (icon), which expands into ABOUT, COMMUNITY, and CONTACT

**FOOTER AND BOTTOM LINKS**\
Congruent across every page and device with the IGYB contact details and headquarters address, followed by (c) ‘I Got You, Boo’, as well as links to the website Terms & Conditions and the IGYB Privacy Policy

**HOME PAGE**\
Everyone is welcomed with the same home page, which allows a user to sign up or log in, click through to the Events page, and browse through a few recent posts in the forum

**ABOUT PAGE**\
Nice and simple: basically just the origin story of IGYB

**COMMUNITY PAGE**\
This is the heart of IGYB! \
Here are the links for the Forum and Events pages

**FORUM PAGE**\
This is where a guest or user would browse posts, and can search or filter for specific keywords. \
Superstars and IGYB Crew (let’s call them both ‘logged in users’ for this part!) can create posts - which are essentially anything they might want to start a thread for. Questions, giving or asking for advice, providing feedback, sharing a recent experience - if they want to share it, this is the place to do so. \
And while guests can’t create posts, they can still search, filter, and browse through all other posts available. 

**WRITE YOUR POST FORM**\
Pretty self explanatory!\
When clicking on 'CREATE A POST', this is a nice pop up form that allows a logged in user to create a post with a title, some tags or keywords, and the content of their post, before hitting submit.

**POST PAGE**\
When a forum post is clicked, the user is taken to a page dedicated to that particular post. \
Here, logged in users can comment on that post in a thread like fashion, and anyone can read the comments previously posted. Again, guests can't comment, but can read all comments.\
There's also a button to click through to the previous or next post.

**EVENTS PAGE**\
This is where a list of all IGYB run events are, as well as events that have been created by Superstars. \
There’s a search bar here to look up specific locations and/or tags too, to help users find events that might be relevant or specific to them. 

**ENTER YOUR EVENT DETAILS FORM**\
Very similar to creating a post, when clicking on 'CREATE AN EVENT', this is a pop up form that allows a logged in user to create an event - whether it’s a get together/gathering/games night/protest/celebration: doesn’t matter!! - and if they want it advertised on the site as an invitation to all, they can post it!

**EVENT PAGE**\
Clicking on a specific event will bring a guest/user through to that event’s page, which simply has more details such as time, location, and and relevant information, and a link to buy tickets (if it’s a ticketed event). 

**CONTACT PAGE**\
Nice and simple: email address, contact number, the physical headquarters address.

**LOG IN PAGE**\
Superstars and IGYB Crew can simply and securely log in with their username and password.

**CREATE AN ACCOUNT PAGE**\
When a guest wants to join the community and create an account, this is where they'll do it!\
The form requires first name, last name, username, email, confirmation of email, date of birth, password, and confirmation of password.\
Additional optional fields are for phone number, **a drop down menu for 'Why are you signing up?'**, and a box to enter keywords that will essentially be tags for your profile.\
The user will have to agree to the IGYB terms and conditions (and can click through to view these).

**PROFILE PAGE**\
Last but not least, the profile page!\
This is for logged in users (obviously!) to view the information they gave upon signup, and allows them to edit if they want to update anything.

**TERMS & CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY PAGES**\
Legal jargon and mumbo jumbo lorem ipsum.

# R2: Dataflow Diagram
[The original diagrams are available here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1EV_tfMlboLjai9heVswIWWG6Jox-3GKY)

![DFD](<images/DFD_unified.png>)
This is the overall DFD for the site. Black arrows indicate where data flows across the site, blue arrows indicate state changes within the same page, purple arrows indicate front-end only navigation with no data flow, and red arrows indicate navigation that occurs when a guest attempts an action they are not authorised to perform.

We have also separated this DFD by role (Guest, Superstar, and Admin) to make it clearer to understand the processes available for each. 
### Guest DFD
Guests are users of the site who are not yet logged in or do not yet have an account. They can sign up, sign in, or browse the site, but they cannot create, update, or delete posts/comments or events
![Guest DFD](<images/DFD_guest.png>)
### Superstar DFD
Superstars are the signed-in users of the site. They have the same processes as a guest, as well as the ability to create update and delete their own comments, posts, and events, and also RSVP to events. 
![Superstar DFD](<images/DFD_superstar.png>)
### Admin DFD
Admins are Superstars with higher authority, and are responsible for maintaining the site. They have all the processes available to the Superstar, but they can also delete other users accounts, posts, comments, and events.

# R6: Screenshots of your Trello board throughout the duration of the project

[Click here for the Trello board 🗓](https://trello.com/b/y0rODp16/got-you-boo)

Our first video call was to firm up our idea of the *I Got You, Boo* website, as well as discuss how we would split the workload for Part A of the assignment.

We agreed that organising the Trello board into a few specific cards with colour coded labels made the most sense and would be easy to follow:

**CARDS:**
- **Resources**
- **To Do**
- **Naomi Ongoing**
- **Ella Ongoing**
- **Jack Ongoing**
- **Done!**
- **Blocked**

**LABELS:**
- **Set up**
- **Planning**
- **In Progress**

![Initial Trello](<images/Initial Trello.png>)

Moving a few items to the **Done!** card right at the beginning gave us all a quick sense of achievement and helped give some momentum to the project.

*Note:* Naomi did create a 'Done!' label for a hot minute, but quickly realised this was redundant (beyond adding another colour to the mix for the fun of it) because the Trello board already included a 'Done!' card 🥴

![First Progress Shot](<images/First Progress Shot.png>)

Within the 'bulkier' items on our cards, we could add descriptions of what was required, as well as due dates and checklists. Admittedly, with us all chipping away at our own corners of the project, updating this was not always up to speed - even if our actual work was!

![Checklist on Trello](<images/Checklist on Trello.png>)

![Other Checklist](<images/Other Checklist.png>)

Using Trello, we also had the option to write comments on any items or cards. However, we found a better option for our group was a Discord server specifically dedicated to the project.

Here, we were able to quickly include links for relevant websites we might use for inspiration, share snapshots and pdfs of our work, and have general conversation to ensure we were all working toward the same goal and on the same page. 

![Discord Server](<images/Discord Server.png>)

Additionally, we aimed for three Zoom calls a week (keeping close to class times), which worked similarly to stand ups: sharing our progress, asking advice or suggestions and fostering a great team spirit along the way.
