###  PURPOSE

DudeBros Incorporated (DudeBros Inc.) were experiencing staff retention problems. Despite their best intentions and efforts, their workforce consisted almost entirely of white collar middle-aged males. 

Over the years, they had employed a diverse group of people that were best suited to each role and were top of their field,  but no matter the pay packet or benefits thrown at them, DudeBros Inc. simply couldn't seem to keep their staff happy or wanting to stay. 

The resounding feedback given in the seemingly countless resignation letters was that it was no place for anyone who didn't quite fit that same macho stereotype. 

So, instead of doubling down and continuing the cycle, Ella, Jack and Naomi were stoked to get a call from DudeBros Inc. asking for help to change their company culture:

And that is where *I Got You, Boo* was born.

The obvious answer was to create some sort of support network for females to feel included, and have a safe place where they could ask for advice, feedback, and other girls alongside them when they felt wildly outnumbered in the workplace.

However, this concept grew: because it's not just women who were in the minority. 

It was also members of the LGBTQI+ community. It was people of colour. It was even red heads, as we found out!

Whether it's something deep like how to navigate changing your pronouns, or if you're the only cat person in a company of dog people, or you're studying a course where everyone seems obsessed with Pokemon and it was the first time you'd heard of Pikachu - feeling like you're in the minority shouldn't mean you feel alone.


### TARGET AUDIENCE

We're proud to say that *I Got You, Boo (IGYB)* is an all-inclusive online community for those who feel like they're on the outer, because everyone should have someone who has their back.

IGYB is a forum with a mentee/mentor mindset encouraged. The purpose of this is to be able to give a safe space for people to reach out to others in a similar role or industry who have possibly fought the same battles, or have learnt by experience, and are now in a place to share that wealth of knowledge and help pave the way in similar circumstances.

While the aim is for people in industries that might be lacking in diversity to have people they can surround themselves with online, it doesn't necessarily have to be strictly business: for example, one of our most recent Superstars is a 17yo male who wanted to learn to crochet, but didn't feel comfortable walking into his local nursing home crochet classes: and he was able to find another Superstar here who has helped him in that journey!

We consider every single member of IGYB a superstar, so that's what we refer to our users as! 

The IGYB Crew are essentially website admins, and this gives them the ability to moderate if necessary. The entire IGYB idea is built on trust and mutual respect, so this isn't a matter of trawling through every single post and comment to follow any particular 'rules', but it still gives IGYB Crew the capability to delete posts, comments or events that have been created and do not uphold the inclusive ethos of IGYB, or to completely delete Superstars if deemed necessary.


### FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURES

The framework of the IGYB site is as follows:

#### Header
‘I got you, boo’ - nice and congruent across every page and device

#### Top Links
Desktop view: ABOUT, COMMUNITY, CONTACT, PROFILE (icon)

Mobile and tablet view: PROFILE (icon), and MENU (icon), which expands into ABOUT, COMMUNITY, and CONTACT

#### Footer and Bottom Links
Congruent across every page and device with the IGYB contact details and headquarters address, followed by (c) ‘I Got You, Boo’, as well as links to the website Terms & Conditions and the IGYB Privacy Policy

#### HOME PAGE
Everyone is welcomed with the same home page, which allows a user to sign up or log in, click through to the Events page, browse through a few of the Spotlighted Superstars, or join the mailing list 

#### ABOUT PAGE
Nice and simple: basically just the origin story of IGYB

#### COMMUNITY PAGE
This is the heart of IGYB! 

Here are the links for the Forum, Events and Superstars pages:

#### FORUM PAGE
This is where a user would create a post, browse posts, and can search or filter for specific keywords. 

Superstars and IGYB Crew (let’s call them ‘logged in users’ for this part!) can create posts - which are essentially anything they might want to start a thread for. Questions, giving or asking for advice, providing feedback, sharing a recent experience - if they want to share it, this is the place to do so. 

And while guests can’t create posts, they can still search, filter, and browse through all other posts available. 

#### POST PAGE
When a forum post is clicked, the user is taken to a page dedicated to that particular post. 

Here, logged in users can comment on that post in a thread like fashion, or click through to the next post. Again, guests can't comment, but can read all comments.

#### EVENTS PAGE
This is where a list of all IGYB run events are, as well as events that have been created by Superstars. 

There’s a search bar here to look up specific locations and/or tags too, to help users find events that might be relevant or specific to them. 

The 'Enter Event Details Here' form is for logged in users who have organised their own event - whether it’s a get together/gathering/games night/protest/celebration: doesn’t matter!! - and if they want it advertised on the site as an invitation to all, they can post it! 

#### EVENT PAGE
Clicking on a specific event will bring a user through to that event’s page, which simply has more details such as time, location, and and relevant information, and a link to buy tickets (if it’s a ticketed event). 

#### SUPERSTARS PAGE
This one is a celebration of our Superstars!!

*Each month we showcase six of our members* with a little bio and story from them. A user can click on each profile card on the SUPERSTARS page to head into that specific Superstar.

*Do you want to have a little spotlight, or know a Superstar who should be showcased? Let us know!*

#### SUPERSTAR PAGE
The expanded version of the story for the Superstar that was clicked on in the previous page

#### CONTACT PAGE
Nice and simple: email address, contact number, the physical headquarters address and a form if a user (guest or logged in - doesn't matter) wants to contact us through the site.

#### SIGN IN PAGE
Superstars and IGYB Crew can simply log in with their username and password here, **or get an email sent through if they forget their password.**

#### CREATE AN ACCOUNT PAGE
Form for creating accounts: requires first name, last name, username, email, confirmation of email, date of birth, password, and confirmation of password. Additional optional fields are for phone number, **a drop down menu for 'Why are you signing up?'**, and a box to enter keywords that will essentially be tags for your profile.

The user will have to agree to the IGYB terms and conditions (and can click through to view these), **and can opt in for the mailing list**.

#### PROFILE PAGE
Last but not least, the profile page!

This is for logged in users (obviously!) to view the information they gave upon signup, and allows them to edit if they want to update anything.

### SUPERSTARS (general users):

#### Liam McGoldrick, he/him, 17, Newcastle

Welllll I figure I'm just a typical guy. I'm in Year 11, surf, and take out the 4x4 with the fellas every weekend, as well as a few shifts at Bunnings each week. Generally, I fit right in, and normally find it easy to make friends. A couple months ago, I started to get a bit stuck on the idea of crochet - seemingly out of NOWHERE - and I wasn't sure who or where to ask for help without the boys finding out ... because I know it's kind of lame.

My original idea was to go where people would be crocheting - nursing homes maybe?? - but that definitely IS lame lol. In a deep dive on the internet searching for helpful communities, I stumbled on the IGYB website. And while the name is kinda girly, I figured I might as well create an anonymous account to ask for help?

I quickly found that the people here were genuinely willing to help me learn and excited for my successful projects - and I've since come forth with my real name and identity when I rock up to the events now - if it's not during school hours or messing with my surf seshes - because there are genuinely good people here.

NEED TO REVISE

#### Chris Watts, he/him, 45, Alice Springs
I guess you could say I'm a 'flamboyant' member of the LGBTQI+ community; identifying as a gay male and expressing myself with a larger than life personality (as well as rainbow coloured nails!).

I came out of the closet in my early twenties, so bang on twenty YEARS ago! And I'm no stranger to odd looks or a whisper after I've walked past someone...

However, having spent most of my adult life in Sydney's diverse inner west, those uncomfortable moments were typically far and few between, and I knew I had a large support network around me to grab a pink gin with at the end of a long day and help me feel part of the community instead of stigmatised by it.

I moved to Alice Springs three months ago to manage one of the bougie Uluru resorts, and was quite frankly blindsided by the overt ostracisation I faced upon arrival here. Unfortunately, the small mindedness of people in Central Australia has seemed to be quite deeply rooted - or at least, that's been my experience so far.

I just needed an extra morale boost and knew I had to be intentional with surrounding myself with inclusive, supportive, loving people, and IGYB has helped me do that through the online community. I never thought I'd need this type of forum or online safe place, but have found it a haven in this chapter of life.

**REVISED USER STORY:**

As a member of the LGBTQI+ community, I need to create a post on IGYB to share my experiences, so that I can connect with others who may have similar stories and build a supportive community.

#### Ben Lenkeith, he/him, 29, Woodvale
You know the Jonah Takaluah skit about Ben the ranga? Well, I've been living that out for my entire existence! 

I'm a red head - which you might never have even thought of as a minority group, but I promise, it makes sense... I was bullied throughout the entirety of of school simply for my hair colour, and to be honest, developed some serious anxiety around it.

I've been working as a craft beer brewer in a little local pub, and although most people in my adult life thought they were simply being funny by making their ranga jokes, I've never been comfortable with it or even really know how to respond. I started dying my hair brown, in order to try and lessen the attention, but my complexion still gives me away!

For the past eight years, I've been seeing a therapist to try and work through the anxiety and find different ways to process my triggers - namely, my hair. My therapist actually pointed me towards IGYB as an alternative way of finding people who accepted me EXACTLY as I am, natural flaming hair colour and all! I joined two years ago, and it's been pretty cool to see how much confidence I've gained since.

**REVISED USER STORY:**

As a red-headed individual who has faced a lifetime of bullying and developed anxiety around my hair color, I need a supportive and understanding community where I can share my experiences without judgment or ridicule.

#### Amy Little, she/her, 27, Wollongong
As a female with autism, I need to organise and post details about a gathering on IGYB, so that I can invite others in the community to join me in a relaxed and understanding environment that accommodates our unique needs.

#### Chase X, they/them, 29, Marrickville
As a member of a marginalised group, I need to customise my profile on IGYB to include relevant information about my identity, so that others can better understand and respect my experiences.

#### Izzie Bowden, she/her, 33, Margaret River
As an ally to marginalised communities, I need to participate in IGYB discussions to learn and understand more about the struggles and triumphs of different groups, so that I can better support and advocate for inclusivity.

#### Julien Guillard, he/him, 38, Adelaide
As a quadriplegic, I need to report inappropriate posts and comments to IGYB admins, so that the community remains a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

#### Cait Williams, she/her, 30, Springfield Lakes
As an individual on the autism spectrum, I need to browse IGYB events to find gatherings that are sensory-friendly, so that I can participate comfortably and connect with like-minded individuals.

#### Ali Lowe, they/them, 37, Geelong
As a person with mental health challenges, I need to share my journey through posts on IGYB, so that I can contribute to reducing the stigma around mental health and inspire hope within the community.

### IGYB CREW (admins):

#### Stace Blackwell, she/her, 24, Cannon Hill
I'm the eldest of three girls, and have always been raised to tackle challenges head on regardless of who tells me 'you're just a girl'. 

I started at DudeBros Inc. three years ago, and had a bit of a challenging time in the company to begin with; even though upper management was wanting to foster an inclusive culture, it was hard to change the mentality of 'the masses'. It was a bit uncomfortable to have to, but I am proud to have been one of the first in the company to actively advocate for less toxic masculinity and more support for everyone *not* in that category. Hence, I was also one of the original Superstars to join IGYB and give feedback here!

Through honest conversations and open minded management, I guess I've been able to help shape IGYB into what it is today, because I understand the need to have a healthy support system in the workplace (and in life!).

**REVISED USER STORY:**

As a woman working in a male-dominated industry, I need to comment on posts within IGYB to provide advice and encouragement to others facing similar challenges, so that we can foster a sense of solidarity and mentorship.

#### Karen Humphries, she/her, 52, Mount Isa
Being a parent to a child with a learning disability has been both a rewarding and challenging journey. Navigating through various support systems and trying to connect with others who truly understand our experiences has often felt like an uphill battle. I stumbled upon IGYB in search of a community that goes beyond mere understanding, a place where we could find solace and strength together.

Joining IGYB wasn't just about attending events; it was about finding a network of families who face similar challenges.  Through this community, I discovered a supportive space where understanding is instinctive, and the collective strength of shared experiences propels us all forward. It's more than just events; it's a family that understands the beauty and resilience in our unique stories.

Becoming an admin on IGYB was a natural progression for me, fuelled by a deep belief in the transformative power of this community. Witnessing firsthand the positive impact IGYB has, I knew I had to play a more active role and am proudly now one of the IGYB Crew.

**REVISED USER STORY:**

As a parent of a child with a learning disability, I need to be able to find, create, and join IGYB events specifically tailored for families like mine, so that we can connect with others facing similar challenges and share resources.

#### Daniel Barbaker, he/him, 34, Louisa
As a mentor with the IGYB Crew, I need the ability to create and schedule mentoring events, so that I can provide guidance and support to members seeking mentorship within the community.

#### Purav Hursh, he/him, 29, Woolloongabba
As an IGYB admin, I need to review and delete inappropriate events organised by users, so that the platform maintains a positive and respectful atmosphere.

#### Stella Frazer, she/her, 33, Townsville
As a member of the IGYB Crew, I need to be able to delete posts or comments that don't align with community guidelines, so that the platform maintains a positive and respectful atmosphere.

#### Braden Long, he/him, 40, Broome
As a mentor with the IGYB Crew, I need to be able to comment on posts to provide more focused guidance to specific subsets of the community, fostering deeper connections and support.
